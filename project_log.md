## [2024-11-20] - Progress Update

**Time**: `2024-11-20 7:48 AM`

- Started building the data pipeline for NASA NeoWs project.
- Worked on setting up the Google Cloud Project.
- Created the service account and it's key.
- Drafted a readme.md file to update much later.

**Thoughts**:
- Felt good about the progress today.
- Need to investigate security practices for pipeline deployment with Cloud Run. Will Docker Swarm be of any good here?
- I wonder if there's a better way to set up Airflow this time.
- I'll test GET requests when I wake up
